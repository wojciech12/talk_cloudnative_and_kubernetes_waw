Effective Platform Building with Kubernetes. Is K8S new Linux?
==============================================================

I will tell you war stories from Kubernetes implementations in two startups: a fashion ecommerce - Lykehq - and Fintech/Machine Learning - SMACC. Getting them to Continuous Deployment, mistakes I made, and how we solve them -- thanks to feedback from `Sven Loth <https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-loth-51b75b5b>`_ (`SMACC <https://smacc.io>`_ CTO). Show why K8S is such a powerful tool and -- most important for me --- it gives you learn-as-you-go experience. The new linux, the new application server some say.
